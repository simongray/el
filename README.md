# Danish electricity calendar
A personalised, auto-updating [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) of Danish electricity prices which you can subscribe to via a [compatible application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_with_iCalendar_support), e.g. Calendar on macOS.

The `dk.simongray.el.prices` namespace is a micro-library for sourcing the latest Danish electricity prices, while `dk.simongray.el.calendar` contains a small Pedestal web service exposing the calendar itself.
